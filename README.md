**NOTE**: I built this in intelliJ, and for reliability I would suggest us all to use it. You can get a free student account [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students).
## Project Structure

### <ins>HelloApplication.java</ins>
Basic screen which, when ran, will draw a small window with an interactive button. This is a good starting point to explore how JFX works.

### <ins>HelloController.java</ins>
File that controls the UI elements of HelloApplication.java. Imagine this is the engine behind the car that is HelloApplication.java.

For cleanliness of code, it would be wise to follow this structure wherein each screen has a corresponding controller. I dont know if there has to be a controller for a screen to run (xamarin does not, but it makes your code look ugly), but we _should_.
